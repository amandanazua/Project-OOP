DENDANGIN - created a simple music player program using Java

We chose the name "DENDANGIN" to suit its
function for listening to singing music, according to our group the name "DENDANGIN" is quite
unique and emphasizes the meaning that this program was created by Indonesia. This program
provides services to users to be able to play the music they want. In this program we include
various features for users to perfect them in using this music streaming program. In building this
program we use the Java language and there are 495 lines of program code that we have made
as effective as possible to run this "DENDANGIN" program.
